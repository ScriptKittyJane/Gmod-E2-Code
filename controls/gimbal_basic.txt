@name Gimbal - Basic
@inputs Prop:entity Driver:entity

### Setup ###
runOnTick(1)
Driver = owner()

### Gimbal ###
Direction = (Driver:aimPos() - Prop:pos()):toAngle()
Prop:setAng(Direction)

### Notes ###
#1: If you want to use this as a normal player, keep "Driver = owner()" as is.
#2: If you want to use this in a vehicle, remove "Driver = owner()" and attach input "Driver:entity" to pod/cam controller aimpos.
#3: Make sure your pod controller has crosshairs on.
#4: Aiming at the Gimbal'd object itself may make it freak out.
